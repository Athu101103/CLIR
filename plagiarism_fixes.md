# Plagiarism Reduction Recommendations

## Replace Generic Academic Phrases

### Current → Improved Alternatives

**Results Section:**
- "significant improvements" → "marked performance gains" / "notable enhancement"
- "substantial gains" → "considerable advances" / "meaningful progress"
- "demonstrates significant improvements" → "exhibits marked enhancement" / "yields considerable progress"

**Literature Review:**
- "Recent studies" → "Current research" / "Latest investigations"
- "Contemporary approaches" → "Current methodologies" / "Present-day techniques"
- "While recent developments" → "Although current advances" / "Despite ongoing progress"
- "Notable advancements" → "Key developments" / "Important progress"

**Methodology:**
- "comprehensive framework" → "integrated architecture" / "unified system"
- "extensive experimental validation" → "thorough empirical assessment" / "detailed performance evaluation"

## Add Distinctive Voice

### 1. Sanskrit-Specific Language
Instead of generic terms, use domain-specific language:
- "ancient language processing challenges"
- "Devanagari script complexities"
- "philosophical discourse understanding"
- "cultural knowledge preservation"

### 2. Technical Specificity
Replace generic ML terms with specific descriptions:
- Instead of "neural architectures" → "transformer-based encoders"
- Instead of "model adaptation" → "parameter-efficient specialization"
- Instead of "cross-lingual performance" → "Sanskrit-English retrieval effectiveness"

### 3. Unique Problem Framing
Emphasize the unique aspects:
- "three-millennia knowledge repository"
- "morphologically complex ancient language"
- "culturally-embedded philosophical concepts"

## Specific Rewrites Needed

### Abstract (Lines 67-72)
Current: "substantial performance gains, achieving an 80.2% enhancement over baseline approaches"
Improved: "marked retrieval effectiveness, yielding 80.2% improvement over conventional methods"

### Introduction (Lines 75-76)
Current: "Contemporary Sanskrit-English CLIR systems encounter several fundamental obstacles"
Improved: "Current Sanskrit-English CLIR frameworks face distinctive challenges"

### Related Work (Lines 84-85)
Current: "Modern neural CLIR approaches leveraging multilingual transformer models"
Improved: "Current transformer-based CLIR systems utilizing multilingual encoders"

### Results (Lines 247-248)
Current: "The data shows significant improvements at each stage of our framework"
Improved: "Our evaluation reveals progressive enhancement across framework components"
## S
trengthen Unique Contributions

### Emphasize Sanskrit-Specific Innovations
1. **Cross-Script Transfer**: Highlight the novel use of Hindi/Marathi/Nepali for Sanskrit understanding
2. **Cultural Context**: Emphasize philosophical concept handling (dharma, moksha, etc.)
3. **Ancient Language Focus**: Stress the unique challenges of 3000-year-old texts

### Add Original Insights
- Discuss specific Sanskrit linguistic features your method addresses
- Explain why traditional CLIR fails for philosophical Sanskrit texts
- Detail the cultural knowledge gap your approach bridges

### Use Domain-Specific Examples
Instead of generic examples, use Sanskrit-specific ones:
- "dharma" concept complexity
- Srimadbhagavatam text characteristics
- Devanagari script variations across languages

## Mathematical Formulations

### Make Equations More Distinctive
Current equations are standard - add Sanskrit-specific elements:
- Include Devanagari character handling in normalization
- Add cultural concept weighting in similarity measures
- Incorporate philosophical domain adaptation terms

## Methodology Improvements

### Add Implementation Details
- Specific Sanskrit preprocessing steps
- Cultural concept handling mechanisms
- Devanagari script normalization procedures

### Include Failure Analysis
- What types of Sanskrit concepts are still challenging?
- Where does cross-script transfer fail?
- Cultural knowledge gaps that remain

## Writing Style Changes

### Use Active Voice More
- "We develop" instead of "is developed"
- "Our framework achieves" instead of "significant improvements are shown"

### Add Personal Research Voice
- "We observe that..." instead of "It is observed that..."
- "Our analysis reveals..." instead of "The analysis shows..."
- "We find..." instead of "It is found that..."

### Vary Sentence Structure
Avoid repetitive patterns like:
- "X shows Y" → Mix with "Y emerges from X", "X yields Y", "Y results from X"## I
